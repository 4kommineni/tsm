           <h4>Extension Denied: Masters from For-Profit University not considered under Masters Quota for H-1B</h4>
           <span class="icon mif-bubbles"></span>
          </div>
          <div class="content padding40 fg-black" style="display: block;">
           <p class="indent-paragraph">If your U.S. master's degree is from a private, for-profit university and you obtained
            your H-1B approval under the Masters Cap exemption, you may run into problems obtaining an H-1B extension. The U.S.
            Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) is taking a second look at H-1Bs approved under the Masters Cap exemption
            after some petitions appear to have been approved in error. For those cases where the initial H-1B petition was
            approved under the Masters Cap and the degree used to qualify for the exemption was from a private, for-profit school,
            the USCIS could deny the H-1B extension on the grounds that the worker was never actually counted towards the H-1B
            numerical limitations and is now subject to the H-1B quota. USCIS could also potentially revoke the approved H-1B
            petition.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">On October 1st of every year, the U.S. government makes available 65,000 H-1B visas for
            the upcoming fiscal year. In addition, there is an advanced degree exemption provided to the first 20,000 petitions
            filed for an individual who has obtained a U.S. master's degree or higher. However, not all U.S. master's degrees are
            created equal when it comes to qualifying for this exemption. The school issuing the master's degree must meet the
            definition of an institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">According to section 101(a), an institution of higher education is an educational
            institution that is, among other things, a public or other nonprofit institution and is accredited by a nationally
            recognized accrediting agency or association or has been granted pre accreditation status by such an agency or
            association recognized for granting pre accreditation status. Under this definition, a university that is private and
            for-profit is not considered an institution of higher education.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">Below is a list of institutions that we have learned do not meet the criteria of United
            States institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Stratford University</li>
            <li>University of Northern Virginia</li>
            <li>Silicon Valley University</li>
            <li>Herguan University</li>
            <li>Goldey-Beacom College</li>
            <li>International Technological University</li>
           </ul>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">If your school is a private, for-profit institution and you obtained an H-1B approval
            under the Masters Cap, you should contact a qualified immigration attorney as soon as possible. With the new filing
            window opening on April 1, 2014, you may need to consider filing a new H-1B petition under the Bachelors Cap in order
            to avoid future problems with your H-1B visa. In addition, if you are a current F-1 student or recent graduate and are
            planning to file an H-1B petition in the upcoming filing window, consult with an attorney before filing under the
            Master CAP exemption if you attended a private, for-profit university.</p>

             <p class="indent-paragraph">Yes. In order to properly file an H-1B petition under the Master CAP exemption, an
              alien beneficiary must possess a master's or higher degree from a United States institution of higher education as
              defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. According to section 101(a), an institution of higher
              education is an educational institution that is, among other things, a public or other nonprofit institution and is
              accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association or has been granted preaccreditation status
              by such an agency or association recognized for granting preaccreditation status. The school that you obtained a

              in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. USCIS can now find that your school does not meet the Master
              CAP exemption and that you are subject to the H-1B numerical limitation.</p></li>

              H-1B petition under the FY 2012 Master CAP and USCIS approved the H-1B petition. I have since traveled to India for
              visa stamping. Am I safe now?</b>
             <p>No. The school that you obtained a Master's degree from is unaccredited and does not meet the definition of an
              institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Successfully
              obtaining a visa stamp does not change this fact. USCIS can now find that your school does not meet the Master CAP
              exemption and that you are subject to the H-1B numerical limitation.</p></li>
            <li><b>In 2010, I obtained a Master's degree from for profit, unaccredited institution in the U.S. I applied
              for an H-1B petition under the FY 2012 Master CAP and USCIS approved the H-1B petition. My current H-1B visa expires
              in September 2014. What should I do now?</b>
             <p>The school that you obtained a Master's degree from is unaccredited and does not meet the definition of an
              institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. With the new

            <li><b>I obtained a Master's degree from a private, for-profit institution in the U.S. I applied for an H-1B
              petition under the FY 2011 Master CAP and USCIS approved my H-1B petition. I filed a petition to extend my H-1B
              status in the fall of 2013 and it was approved. Am I safe now?</b>
             <p class="indent-paragraph">No. In recent months, the California Service Center has denied extension petitions of
              H-1B Beneficiaries whose initial H-1B petitions were filed under the Master CAP exemption based on Master's or
              higher degrees from universities that do not meet the definition of an institution of higher education as defined in
              section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The school that you obtained a Master's degree from is
              for-profit and does not meet the definition of an institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of
              the Higher Education Act of 1965. USCIS is not required to approve petitions where eligibility has not been
              demonstrated, merely because of prior approvals which may have been erroneous.</p></li>

              H-1B petition under the FY 2009 Master CAP and USCIS approved the H-1B petition. My I-140 was approved in 2011 and I
              now I am just waiting for my priority date to become current in order to file my I-485. Am I safe?</b>
             <p>If you are currently in H-1B status, the answer is no. The school that you obtained a Master's degree from is
              unaccredited and does not meet the definition of an institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of
              the Higher Education Act of 1965. Successfully filing an I-140 does not change this fact. USCIS can now find that

              obtained a Master's degree from a private, unaccredited university. I applied for an H-1B petition under the FY 2014
              Master CAP and USCIS approved the H-1B petition. Will this cause any problems in the future for me?</b>
             <p class="indent-paragraph">You obtained one of your Master's degrees from a school that meets the definition of
              an institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. As this school
              meets the Master CAP exemption, you are not subject to the H-1B numerical limitation based on your previously
              granted H-1B nonimmigrant status in the past 6 years.</p></li>
            <li><b>I recently graduated with a Master's degree from a private, for-profit institution in the U.S. and I

             <p>The school that you obtained a Master's degree from is for-profit and does not meet the definition of an
              institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Consult with an

           <h4>Scammers Not Sparing Lawyers Either - They are Getting Bold</h4>
           <span class="icon mif-bubbles"></span>
          </div>
          <div class="content padding40 fg-black" style="display: block;">
           <p class="indent-paragraph">We recently informed readers of our weekly newsletter about a telephone scam targeting
            Indian immigrants to try to get money. This morning the scam reached our own office when Attorney Rahul Reddy received
            a phone call from an individual claiming to be from the Bureau of Criminal Investigations. Initially, the caller tried
            to reach Mr. Reddy at his home phone number. Mr. Reddy's cell phone number was provided to the caller and minutes
            later, a threatening voicemail message was left on his cell phone about legal action that was being taken against his
            identity. Anticipating that the call was related to the same scam discussed earlier, Mr. Reddy called back to find out
            how the scam works.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">A Senior Criminal Investigator named Don Lawson took the call. He asked if there had
            been any contact with the local police department or the Bureau of Criminal Investigations. He proceeded to tell Mr.
            Reddy that there was an affidavit filed against him by the government because he violated the tax code of 1967 and
            mentioned two other charges related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a criminal investigation.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">The scammer said that if he did not take care of it right now, the local police would
            immediately come to his home to arrest him. Mr. Reddy asked how it can be taken care of and the scammer said that,
            according to the affidavit, the IRS is ready to file a criminal case against Mr. Reddy unless he agrees to a
            settlement amount of $3,464. If he did not agree, then he could fight the case in court but it would cost $72,000. He
            could avoid all the hassle by paying $3,464 right now. And if it later turns out that the charges were a mistake, they
            would refund 80% of the money.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">The scammer gave instructions for making the payment of $3,464. Apparently they do not
            accept checks and their 'EFT system' was down so they could not take credit card payments over the phone. Mr. Reddy
            was asked to obtain 'Green Dot Money Cards', conveniently available at any Wal-Mart store. He was instructed to buy 3
            prepaid cards in the amount of $1,000 each and one card in the amount of $464. The caller would not allow Mr. Reddy to
            call back after he obtained the cards. He instructed that he would wait on hold while Mr. Reddy went to the store to
            purchase the cards. Then he would take the card information over the phone. If Mr. Reddy were to hang up during this
            process, the police would immediately be notified to arrest him. As soon as the payment is made, the scammer told him
            all charges will be dropped.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">At this point, Mr. Reddy informed the scammer that he would complain to the authorities
            and the call was immediately disconnected by the scammer. While it may seem easy for many to conclude that this kind
            of call is just a scam and hang up, clearly there are people out there who followed the caller's instructions and were
            cheated out of a large amount of money. Otherwise, these scammers would be out of business. Don't be a victim!</p>

           <h4>10,000 U Visas approved for 5th Straight Fiscal Year</h4>

           <p class="indent-paragraph">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved the statutory maximum
            10,000 petitions for U-1 nonimmigrant status (U visas) for fiscal year 2014. This marks the fifth straight year that
            USCIS has reached the statutory maximum since it began issuing U visas in 2008.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">Each year, 10,000 U visas are available for victims of certain qualifying crimes who
            have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse and are willing to help law enforcement authorities investigate or
            prosecute those crimes. A U visa petition requires certification of assistance from law enforcement.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">Congress created the U visa program to strengthen the law enforcement communitys
            ability to investigate and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other crimes,
            while also offering protection to victims. More than 89,600 victims and their family members have received U visas
            since the program was implemented in 2008.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">Though USCIS has reached its statutory cap of 10,000 U visas, it will continue to
            review pending petitions for eligibility. USCIS will send a letter to all eligible petitioners who, due solely to the
            cap, are not granted U-1 visas, notifying them that they are on a waiting list to receive a U visa when visas again
            become available and what options they have in the interim. Petitioners and qualifying family members must continue to
            meet eligibility requirements at the time the U visa is issued.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">USCIS will resume issuing U visas on Oct. 1, 2014, the first day of fiscal year 2015,
            when visas become available again.</p>

           <h4>Ohio restaurant owners and managers indicted for hiring Illegal workers</h4>
           <span class="icon mif-bubbles"></span>
          </div>
          <div class="content padding40 fg-black" style="display: block;">
           <p class="indent-paragraph">A federal grand jury returned a 23-count indictment charging six people for their roles
            in a conspiracy to hire illegal workers at a chain of restaurants in Stark and Summit counties and pay them less than
            minimum wage and sometimes only in tips. The indictments are the result of a joint investigation by U.S. Immigration
            and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Department of Labor Office of Inspector
            General.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">The indictment names owners Miguel Castro, 44, and Monica Castro, 43, both of
            Uniontown; and managers Cesar Castro, 28, of Akron; Aldo Castro,42, of Akron; Pedro Cervantes, 39, of Mexico; and
            Gustavo Torres, 45, of Kent.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">"The owners and managers of these restaurants took advantage of their workers'
            immigration status for their own profit," said Steven Dettelbach, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">"Employers have a legal responsibility to protect the integrity of their workforce,"
            said Marlon Miller, special agent in charge for HSI Detroit, which covers Michigan and Ohio. "When companies engage in
            schemes that flout immigration laws, workers are often exploited and businesses that play by the rules are put at a
            significant disadvantage."</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">The defendants face charges including conspiracy to harbor undocumented aliens, aiding
            and abetting the harboring of undocumented aliens, harboring undocumented aliens, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and
            mail fraud. Miguel Castro and Monica Castro also are charged with making false statements to federal law enforcement
            officers.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">Since 2002, the defendants owned and/or managed the seven "Mariachi Locos" and
            "Mariachi Cocos" chain of restaurants with locations in Akron, Stow, Tallmadge and North Canton.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">The defendants engaged in the practice of hiring undocumented workers who were
            illegally present in the United States and conspired to shield these workers from detection by paying them in cash,
            excluding them from payrolls, leasing housing for the workers and aiding the workers in obtaining fraudulent work
            documentation, according to the indictment.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">The defendants also mailed false wage reports to the state of Ohio.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">The defendants' employment practices enabled them to enrich themselves because they
            paid the undocumented workers less than minimum wage and did not pay these workers for overtime hours. In some cases,
            the defendants paid these workers only the tips the workers received from their customers, according to the
            indictment.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">The indictment also seeks the forfeiture of $16.47 million in gross proceeds that the
            defendants earned as a result of the offenses.If convicted, the defendants' sentences will be determined by the court
            after review of factors unique to this case, including the defendants' prior criminal record, if any, the defendants'
            roles in the offense and the characteristics of the violations. In all cases, the sentence will not exceed the
            statutory maximum and in most cases it will be less than the maximum.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lauren Bell and Phillip J. Tripi are prosecuting this case.</p>
           <p class="indent-paragraph">An indictment is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to
            a fair trial in which it will be the government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
